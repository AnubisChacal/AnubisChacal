# üëã Hello world
I'm an InfoSec enthusiast with a strong background in network infrastructure and a growing focus on offensive security. I have hands-on experience with SOC operations and Fortinet Firewalls, and I'm diving deeper into penetration testing and Red Team tactics. I enjoy working on projects that involve automation using Selenium and Python, as well as containerization with Docker. Currently, I'm working towards certifications in offensive and cloud security. I'm always up for collaboration to create secure and efficient solutions.
